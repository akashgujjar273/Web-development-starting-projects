            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The Lamborghini Miura, produced from 1966–1973, is often said to be the
                first supercar.By the 1970s and 1980s the term was in regular use, if not precisely
                defined.One interpretation up until the 1990s was to use it for mid-engine two-seat cars with at
                least eight cylinders (but typically a V12 engine), a power output of at least 400 bhp (298 kW) and a
                top speed of at least 180 mph (290 km/h).Other interpretations state that "it must be very fast,
                with sporting handling to match", "it should be sleek and eye-catching" and its price should be "one in
                a rarefied atmosphere of its own" or regard exclusivity (i.e. limited production volumes) as an
                important characteristic.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">What is a supercar? It's a term these days that's so casually used it
                seems that nobody really knows what the true meaning is anymore. There aren't just a few brands making
                insanely high-performance, high-design vehicles anymore. There are cars coming out of places you rarely
                hear about, like Dubai (W Motors) or Croation (Rimac). And with the rise of car blogging, where anybody
                can say anything on the Internet, it seems that so many cars these days are catching the tag "supercar"
                that don't really deserve it.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">One person’s car is another person’s scenery. </p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">There are many factors that make a high performance car deserving of the
                title, supercar. The biggest factor is performance. Performance is made up of three parts: handling,
                power, and speed. Handling is how well the vehicle goes around a corner, which depends on the vehicle’s
                weight and suspension. A lighter vehicle will corner faster than one with heavier weight because
                centrifugal force which pulls a rotating body away from itself. Suspension is also key because it
                reduces body roll. Body roll is how the weight of the car transferred from side to side. The heavier the
                car, the more body roll which in turn, slows the car down. Power is another important factor in becoming
                a supercar. Power is created by the engine which is then interpreted into horsepower and measured in
                watts. Horsepower originated for horses pulling power against a steam engine.</p>
