        <p class="font1">All Might's hero persona appears to be derived from comic book superhero stereotypes: colorful
            and filled with dramatic flair. Always sporting a giant smile, All Might shows a bright, can-do attitude
            that is said to inspire others as well as help them feel safe and hopeful. Though he can go overboard and
            annoy others. He is extremely friendly and amicable due to his popularity and years in the spotlight, always
            taking his time to interact with fans.

            Once All Might reverts to his true form, however, he becomes less energetic and more serious, generally
            taking a milder stance so as to not attract much attention to himself, in direct contrast to the grandiosity
            of his hero identity. While he's an optimist, he still ensures his goals are grounded in reality. When a
            Quirkless Izuku tells him about his goal of becoming a hero, All Might praises him for having a dream, but
            reminds him to stay realistic and suggests he enter another profession that helps people. He considered the
            harsh words necessary to save the boy from long-term frustration. In this form, he frequently vomits blood
            as an indicator of his fragile health, although it might happen if he gets surprised or amused enough. Two
            personality traits that seem to be always present on him, regardless of which form All Might is currently
            taking, are his optimism and oafishness. He can be borderline obnoxious at times, using his own voice as a
            ringtone.Since his young days, All Might had always carried a single, yet burdensome goal in his mind: to
            become a pillar of hope that people could always rely upon during harsh times. Indeed, after obtaining One
            For All from his master, Nana Shimura, as well as inheriting her habit of smiling at all times, All Might
            rose to become not only a hero but a legend, no thanks to his seemingly endless competency and charisma. No
            matter who or what he faced, All Might would stand up triumphantly every time one battle after another,
            inspiring the world and sending fear to the hearts of villains everywhere. He considered it necessary to lie
            to the public about his weakened state, for the sake of keeping up morale. He attempted to save so many
            people, it soon became an impractical habit. He exhausted himself and fell behind on other heroes duties,
            such as filing paperwork. Though he was ashamed of himself, he still gratefully accepted the offer of Sir
            Nighteye and Naomasa Tsukauchi to file his reports.

            Unfortunately for All Might, injuries inflicted on his body were starting to take a toll on him. Despite the
            concern and warnings from some of his close associates, All Might's determination to preserve society from
            evil prevented him from relinquishing his role as the Symbol of Peace. His smile, once a gesture that served
            to calm others, started becoming more of a way for All Might to hide his fears and insecurities from the
            general population. As time passed, All Might began to forget some of the basic principles of heroism, until
            Izuku, in a brave attempt to save Katsuki Bakugo from the Sludge Villain's attack despite being Quirkless,
            rekindled his heroic spirit and taught him that something can always be done to fight injustice.</p>
